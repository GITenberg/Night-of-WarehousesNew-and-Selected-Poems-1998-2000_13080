AD 120) }{\i\f20\fs20 trans}{\f20\fs20 . Arthur Waley\par \par \par }{\f20 At first there was\par brilliant sunlight\par anticipating earlier\par \par \par years. A breath of\par lit wind that did not\par possess any location\par \par \par dissolved back into\par the evenness of day,\par became a gift-wrapped\par \par \par surprise from an\par unknown friend unthought\par of until then.\par \par \par Earthquakes which\par rumoured those things\par done and forgotten\par \par \par were sufficiently\par compacted in some other\par and inhuman memory,\par \par \par for every creature\par must have its fair say\par at the end as did these.\par \par \par The anti-climax \par had been expected \par and surprised one.\par \par \par Without a scream\par the disasters continued\par unhurried, as if it\par \page were an appointment\par that had to be kept; \par for this had always been\par \par \par arriving beyond any\par personal memory of the\par wisest man that might\par \par \par have served as an\par invitation, warning. When\par the comet finally\par \par \par described the finitude\par of the heavens, coming\par back a millennium\par \par \par later, we remembered\par his words about the\par serpent consuming its tail.\par \page M A N N E D   M I S S I O N   T O   T H E   G R E E N   P L A N E T\par \par \par Behind some night bush Rousseau green, \par some dwelling in one place, some in another,\par it had been agreed between us by courier\par and hesitation to meet in the village centre\par at midnight. The first figure to emerge\par was to be greeted this: }{\i\f20 America comes to}{\f20 \par }{\i\f20 interpret its humour:}{\f20  the hurried reply; \par }{\i\f20 community halls abound.}{\f20  Back, beyond our\par allotted frequency, The General who had\par not been posted gathered over another Power\par Lunch. After the brief and the oiling of\par rifles we set forth across the causeway\par through the marble green of foothills, \par into the grey of higher ground. The thought,\par like a saffron scarf caught on a thorn\par bush seemed even now on the closed terrain a\par crusade of sorts, - kept us ahead. Amply,\par unnumbered rivers plashed into the battery\par green of immeasurable hollows. So it was\par that we became inseparable, spirit creatures\par to the forest life, the journey boundless,\par the orders which concerned the depot, unread.\par \page A S   T H E   P A I N T E R   M O V E S   T O W A R D   H I S   C A N VA S\par \par \par 1.\par \par Momentarily; we knew we could\par own nothing. An orchestra crackled\par in parenthesis on the emergency\par band as if from another age. Through\par mountain passes the white dirigible\par tilted at electrical storms. Yet,\par what felt like fear looked like a\par pink, tropical orchid in close up,\par deadly in every detail. The colour\par plate said it, though got mixed with\par others after the catalogue got\par lost. An afternoon hot and steamy.\par After the rain had finished the\par thought came through like a gilded\par sun that we could luxuriate our\par every wish, music too, if we wanted.\par \par \par Civic Leaders pushed their pitch:\par the tallest building in the southern\par hemisphere (Sydney) was soon \par to rise beyond the computer graphic,\par apparitional as a water spout!\par O the half sunk water wheel rests its\par spokes on the ancient river basin,\par only to re-emerge as the harbour\par bridge into early morning, traffic fog.\par And passing by the Western Quarter,\par open frontages, cotton shirts, rack\par upon rack, hot smell of metal on felt,\par often backing onto smaller factories\par and interwoven lanes, sometimes\par a glimpse of whitewash hanging out \par picket-fence lettering: }{\f20\fs20 EVERY SPECIES}{\f20\fs18 \par }{\f20\fs20 IS AN ENDANGERED SPECIES}{\f20  and claims\par \page to long-lost sacred sites. Charcoal\par flaked fences under yellow gorse,\par the valley falling away to memory of\par bush fires which swept long before\par his boyhood took this place as playground,\par an image now taut as comprehension.\par \par \par 11.\par \par Pull in from celluloid an early\par afternoon from 1954 (Rpt) pulsing\par cloud up mountain valleys seen on\par location in Peru as you recalled then\par someone toppling two miles through\par thin air - }{\i\f20 Chuck,}{\f20  our hero, black leather \par jacket hard-pressed against the \par mountain. Yet, it was the light which \par figured, flickering there in your\par young matinee years some found memory,\par reservoir to intelligence, long ago.\par Not the mop-topped birds, nor the sun\par heading toward warmer seasons\par built out of piano notes from the\par echoing school facing the little park.\par But turning through those chords,\par something you had to say lies behind\par where it always was. That empty\par space calls you now, asks your energy\par and faith more than the body can\par give, to finally give out. The day\par shoulders through our personal gravities.\par With a slight shift on the wind\par current as if to eventually make up its\par mind, the white dirigible turns cloud\par faint over the long horizon - its\par guy-ropes whisker thin, the day languid.\par \page H A L L O   M O O N,   }{\i\f20\fs20 H A L L O   M O O N}{\i\f20\fs18 \par }{\f20 \par \par Janis Joplin had duende, made her feel\par good but can you take it?

Above glass\par office blocks, black as tornadoes,\par the gong beat out again, boomed\par the length of Queen Street.\par At Aotea Square the crowd smiles,\par hangs in the balance under an\par overturned moon. A hundred heads\par turn as one to meet recognition.\par And the dream? That becomes\par the body working inside its costume.\par }{\i\f20 The breaking of the shield.}{\f20 \par Night falls with a thickness of\par batons. Riot police, armed,\par visored, moving upon the hobbled\par hearts of the people (violent\par against property and themselves)\par moving from side-streets under\par shields, riot police moving in one\par black net to catch Auckland.\par And the deed? That becomes a \par moment in time. The moon thumps \par the blue wrists of Queen Street \par up from a darkening sea. The Lady \par Mayor walks by flashing cameras, \par walks by the doll-house city broken \par on the black and white screen of \par Aotea Square. And this hour turns \par the colour of pale, lemon light.\par }{\i\f20 The breaking of the shield.\par \page }{\f20 G U A R D I A N S,   N O T   A N G E L S\par \par \par Lake Wairarapa?

Gold tussock suggests\par it. A deepening breath defines\par to a temporary surface,\par vapours through heat, sinks, rises\par again. As though it wished to\par retrieve itself back through\par time and is remembered elsewhere.\par No one knows how,\par yet a certain guesswork stays,\par like the way Turner blurred the sky\par and smeared the shock of living,\par made a moist gauze of light.\par Could it be done?\par To reshape the globe into a cube\par not flung elliptical,\par but rolled upon its points.\par Continuously, the unseen figure\par stumbles out of the park\par made perfect by a perfect hand,\par and under a scapula moon chases\par }{\i\f20 thought }{\f20 toward contentment.\par \page N I C H O L A S   C H A R L E S   B O C H S A   1 7 9 1 - 1 8 5 6\par \par }{\i\f20\fs20 \tab \tab Camperdown cemetery, Sydney}{\i\f20\fs18 \par }{\f20 \par \par I liked your story and the\par stone placed by your lover, Ann\par Bishop, in St Stephen\rquote s cemetery.\par How Ann left her composer\par husband Henry to his knighthood\par and in Paris found you, Nicholas\par Bochsa.
